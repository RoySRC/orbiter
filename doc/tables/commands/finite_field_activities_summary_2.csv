1,"\verb'-transversal' ","  $L1$ $L2$ $P$ ","Computes the unique transversal to the lines $L1$ and $L2$ through the point $P$ in $\PG(3,q).$ The linese are given by a basis consisting of $8$ field elements.  "
1,"\verb'-intersection_of_two_lines' ","  $L1$ $L2$ ","Computes the intersection of two lines in $\PG(3,q)$. The linese are given by a basis consisting of $8$ field elements.  "
1,"\verb'-rank_point_in_PG' ","  $P$ ","Computes the orbiter point rank corresponding to the point $P$ in $\PG(n,q).$ $P$ is a label of a vector, which is the coefficient vector.  "
